# DnDCharacterSheetApp
This application is meant to serve as a free alternative to webapps such as D&amp;D Beyond that require subscription or purchases to access content. While I recommend you still purchase source books to get the full information available, I do not believe in limiting character creation options behind a paywall. I am a single developer at the moment working on this, and this is meant to simply be a hobby in my spare time as I want to work on it. There is a lot of 5e content, and as I work on things I will try to release them, though I would like to release things in chunks based on source material. Player Handbook (PHB) content will be the first source I plan to make, and things will go from there.

## Current plans
My initial few commits will be simply setting up GUI (Menus, Buttons, Etc.), while I decide exactly how I want the app to look. This is going to be written in Java, most likely, as it is the language I am most familiar with, and I like the platform independence of it.

### Optional Features
These are some of the things I may include at some point, but cannot guarantee at this time:
- Ability to view information on a particular source entry in a popup (may do a text on hover instead, whichever I feel at the time)
- Ability to include homebrew content easily through a particular syntax (Likely JSON or similar for sake of simplicity)
- Ability to export content to a file that can be sent to another person to import into their sheet (i.e., easy sharing of homebrew content)

## How to Contact or Request Content Additions
First I would like to say that, as a single developer, things will take me time to incorporate. I plan on including ALL official (as in, printed and published by Wizards of the Coast) content as far as items, classes, etc. go. This may or may not include Unearthed Arcana (UA) content, as they are technically not official releases. With this in mind, please keep requests scarce, to 3rd-Party or Homebrew content, and allow me a chance to actually get to the new content before badgering me about it. I am doing this for free at this point in time, and will not tolerate being berrated on spending my skills on this.

To request new content, please open an issue with the subject having "CONTENT REQUEST" of some variation in the title. From there, give me as accurate a description as possible of what you want added and if I feel like adding it in, I will reply to your issue and say I will get on it.

At this time, I am not going to list any contact information. If this takes off and people enjoy it, I will create a Discord server and link the invitation within this file or in the project description. I will take this one step at a time to make sure I am not overwhelmed by this task.

### Assisting with Development
If you would like to be a part of the development of this app, please let me know and I will figure out how to do the pull requests thing. I am fairly new to GitHub still, so I still need to learn everything. For the time being, you are free to fork the project and submit a pull request, though I will review it before adding it in anywhere. If you become a frequent assistant, I may reach out to you regarding helping out more with the project, but please keep in mind that for the time being this is a completely volunteer project, and as such any assistance will also be volunteer until I determine the project is successful enough to be otherwise.
