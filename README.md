# DnDCharacterSheetApp
This application is meant to serve as a free alternative to webapps such as D&amp;D Beyond that require subscription or purchases to access content. While I recommend you still purchase source books to get the full information available, I do not believe in limiting character creation options behind a paywall. I am a single developer at the moment working on this, and this is meant to simply be a hobby in my spare time as I want to work on it. There is a lot of 5e content, and as I work on things I will try to release them, though I would like to release things in chunks based on source material. Player Handbook (PHB) content will be the first source I plan to make, and things will go from there.
